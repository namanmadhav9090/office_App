According to the task requirements and the context you’ve provided, managers should not perform CRUD operations on employees directly. Instead, their role is focused on managing departments. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

Manager Responsibilities
CRUD Operations on Departments:

Create: Add new departments.
Read: View department details.
Update: Modify department details, including assigning or reassigning employees.
Delete: Remove departments.
Assign Employees to Departments:

Assign Employees: Managers can assign existing employees to departments but cannot create or modify employee records directly.
Employee Management Flow
Employees are managed separately and typically involve:

Employee Registration:

Employees register themselves or are added by an administrative process but not by managers.
Employee CRUD Operations:

Handled separately, possibly by an HR role or administrative user, not by managers. This might be done through different administrative interfaces or systems.
Updated API Design Based on Responsibilities
1. Department API Endpoints for Managers
Create Department:

Endpoint: POST /api/departments
Description: Create a new department.
Request Body: { departmentName, categoryName, location, salary }
Get All Departments:

Endpoint: GET /api/departments
Description: Retrieve a paginated list of departments managed by the manager.
Get Department by ID:

Endpoint: GET /api/departments/:id
Description: Retrieve details of a specific department.
Update Department:

Endpoint: PUT /api/departments/:id
Description: Update department details.
Delete Department:

Endpoint: DELETE /api/departments/:id
Description: Delete a department.
Assign Employees to Department:

Endpoint: POST /api/departments/:id/employees
Description: Assign multiple employees to a department.
Request Body: { employeeIds: [array of employee IDs] }
Get Employees in Department:

Endpoint: GET /api/departments/:id/employees
Description: Retrieve a list of employees assigned to a specific department.
2. Employee API Endpoints
Since managers don’t handle direct employee CRUD operations, these APIs would be managed elsewhere:

Create Employee:

Endpoint: POST /api/employees
Description: Register a new employee.
Get Employee by ID:

Endpoint: GET /api/employees/:id
Description: Retrieve employee details.
Update Employee:

Endpoint: PUT /api/employees/:id
Description: Update employee details.
Delete Employee:

Endpoint: DELETE /api/employees/:id
Description: Remove an employee.
Summary
Managers:

Focus on departments, including creating, updating, and deleting departments.
Assign existing employees to departments but don’t create or modify employee records.
Employees:

Managed separately through different APIs or administrative interfaces.
By adhering to these roles and responsibilities, you ensure a clear separation of duties and prevent managers from having unnecessary access to employee management functions. This approach aligns with the typical organizational structure where different roles have distinct responsibilities.
